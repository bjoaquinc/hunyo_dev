      Thank you for your interest. Hunyo is a free, closed community of
      Southeast Asian designers in the built environment dedicated to knowledge
      sharing. <br />
      <br />
      We are an invite-only platform. If you would like to join our wait list
      please email us at
      <span class="text-weight-bold text-primary">hello@hunyo.com</span> and
      tell us briefly why you’re interested in joining Hunyo.<br />
      <br />
      Kindly note that at the moment, Hunyo is only accepting licensed
      architects. You don’t need to be Southeast Asian to apply, but it’s a
      bonus if you are. We will accept other designers in the near future so
      check back here for updates.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you, <br />
      The Hunyo Team
